 national_bolshevik_ideology_desc:0  "National Bolshevism is a Third positionist ideology that combines far-right and far-left positions. The origin of National Bolshevism can be traced back to the years following the Russian Revolution, when nationalist groups supportive of the new communist government broke with Lenin over the "national question" and sought their own countries, or for a more Russian-nationalist form of socialism. It was also briefly popular in Germany in the 1920s; its German supporters identified with the USSR because of their opposition to western liberalism and capitalism."
