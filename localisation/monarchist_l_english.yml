 monarchy.4.t: "Rise of the Monarchy?"
 monarchy.4.desc: "With the influence of the monarchists in Italy, some debate among them have started. Most monarchists support giving House of Savoy the powers he had before the rise of fascism. However, a small but dedicated faction, say the Pope is a more qualified candidate. This faction points to how King Victor Emmanuel III supported Benito Mussolini as evidence to why the House of Savoy is now longer qualified to claim rule of Italians. To add to the confusion further, a Southern Italian Groups are calling for the current head of House Bourbon-Parma to claim the throne, pointing out the previous Kings support of Mussolini's Regime and denouncing the "power play" performed by the Holy See. Who should be crowned the king of the new Kingdom of Italy?"

 monarchy.6.a: "The Kaiser is dead! Long live the Kaiser!"
 monarchy.6.b: "We, however, displayed Nazi regalia against his wishes!"
 monarchy.7.t:0 "Monarchism on the Rise"
 monarchy.7.d:0 "'The [Root.GetAdjective] people long for a sense of tradition and hierarchy. Only a monarch can fill this basic human need. In addition, kings are nonpartisan heads of state and ensures everyone has representation, not just their party!'\n\nThe monarchist speakers in [Root.GetName] have made no secret of what they think of our current rulership and political system. Speeches like these have tapped into a public dissent that is particularly pronounced in the more conservative sections of the government."
 monarchy.7.a:0 "The higher-ups may harbor unspoken sympathies."
 monarchy.7.a.tt:0 "Increases the chance of internal support for a monarchist coup."
 monarchy.7.b:0 "The younger generation will fight for tradition."

 monarchy.8.t:0 "Monarchist Sympathies in the Government"
 monarchy.8.d:1 "Several prominent members of the [Root.GetAdjective] government have expressed support, some privately and some openly, for the Monarchist movement in [Root.GetName]. They feel the [Root.GetRulingParty] has forgotten how important tradition is to keeping the country together, and are increasingly annoyed by the liberal and social reforms in the recent years. Some of them go as far as to suggest that a new government is needed, one that knows how to lead [Root.GetName] into greatness.\n\nThis faction may not predominantly be oridinary citizens, but some smooth talking politicans are wooing people into support a monarch. If these developments continue, they may have sufficient political support to execute a coup."

 monarchy.9.t:0 "Monarchist Coup d'état"
 monarchy.9.d:0 "Some will say they saw it coming. Both those who warned against the dangers of monarchism and other reactionary ideologies and those who extolled it as the savior of [Root.GetName] have found their prophecies made reality today, as some prominent politicians in [Root.Capital.GetName] overthrew the [Root.GetRulingParty]-led government and crowned a monarch. [Root.GetLeader] is missing, rumored to have gone into exile, and the coup has been met with little initial resistance.\n\nThe new [Root.GetAdjective] leadership has plans to discuss what the new monarch's powers should be but, in the mean time, martial law has been declared to stifle any potential resistance."
 monarchy.9.a:0 "A monarch is the collective will of the people."
 monarchy.10.t:0 "Civil War for Monarchism"
 monarchy.10.d:1 "While the attempts of the monarchist movement to revive a sense of historical pride have seen some success, the resistance against these ideas remains high. The politicians plotting to overthrow the current administration are disappointed in the lack of confidence the [Root.GetAdjective] population themselves seem to have in the possibility of a monarch.\n\nThey remain certain that the people will eventually tire of [Root.GetLeader], but are divided on what course of action to take. Some call for a coup to be executed now, before [Root.GetName]'s enemies take action. However, doing so while public support is limited would plunge the nation into civil war."
 monarchy.10.a:0 "A monarch wields absolute power."
 monarchy.10.b:0 "A monarch must have the support of the people."
 monarchy.11.t:0 "Monarchists Question Democratic Traditions"
 monarchy.11.d:0 "The fact so many of our citizens support monarchy over democracy is still something that [Root.GetLeader] is coming to terms with. \"The right to choose one's leader is something that should be considered a basic human right,\" exclaimed [Root.GetLeader] in a private meeting with some members of the government. Regardless of the feelings of [Root.GetLeader], many in our country seem to want a monarch."

 monarchy.12.t:0 "The Threat of Communism"
 monarchy.12.d:0 "'[Root.GetLeader] would have you believe [Root.GetName] stands safe and united. It is no surprise such lies have poisoned the minds of our people, when a snake is coiled up next door! Look no further than across our border to see countrymen having turned on each other in the name of communism, declaring the end of nations. How long until they declare our nation dead as well? Will the [Root.GetRulingParty] protect us from this threat?'\n\nThe growth of the monarchist movement in [Root.GetName] has been bolstered by the proximity of the communist and anarchist revolution. Many moderates who might normally dismiss monarchism as another failed ideology find this to be a very real concern for them as well. Given the choice between the communism and anarchism of our neighbors and an absolute monarch, they would admittedly prefer the latter. They might even be willing to actively support it."

 monarchy.15.t:0 "Death of Pius XI"
 monarchy.15.d:0 "Pope Pius XI had been ill for some time when, on 25 November 1938, he suffered two heart attacks within several hours.

He suffered a third and final heart attack today. His last words were \"My soul parts from you all in peace.\" The College of Cardinals have convened to determine a new pope. They chose an Italian named Eugenio Pacelli."
 monarchy.15.a:0 "He shall now be known as Pope Pius XII."
 monarchy.16.t:0 "Rise of Nationalism"
 monarchy.16.d:0 "Recently in [Root.GetName], nationalism has been stirring among the population. People are growing proud of the country and kinsmen, but skeptical and hostile toward those they perceive as outsiders. Nationalism can manifest itself in various different ways. Recently, it seems across the planet, nationalism means fascism and with fascism comes a stark opposition to liberalism, Marxism, and anarchism. However, nationalism can also be seen as a longing for the past. This longing for the past can cause people to desire monarchs even if the rest of the world seems to be phasing them out.\n\nWhat kind of characteristics does our country's nationalism entail?"

 monarchy.17.b:0 "Okay."
 monarchy.17.c:0 "Who cares about monarchist scum?"
 monarchy.18.t:0 "Death of Christian X"
 monarchy.18.d:0 "Today, King Christian X passed away. Christian X was a controvestial figure because fo his reluctance to embrace republicanism. This led to the Easter Crisis of 1920, in which he dismissed the democratically elected cabinet, and instated one of his own choosing. This was his right as king, but facing the risk of the monarchy being overthrown he was forced to accept democratic control of the state and his role as a nominal constitutional monarch.\n\nIn spite of his resistance to democracy, during the war with Germany, he became a popular symbol of defiance. In addition, he helped finance the transport of Danish Jews to unoccupied lands where they would be safe from Nazi persecution."

 monarchy.18.c:0 "More monarchist scum dead!"
 monarchy.19.t:0 "Death of Frederick Charles"
 monarchy.19.d:0 "Today, King Frederick Charles passed away. Frederick Charles was elected 'King of Finland' by the Finnish Parliament on 1918 October 9. However, with the end of World War I, in light of his German birth and the abdication of Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany ending the German monarchy, the arragement was considered untenable by many Finns and by Frederick himself. Frederick renounced the throne on 1918 December 14 without every arriving in the country, much less being crowned. Finland subsequently adopted a republican constitution."

 monarchy.20.t:0 "Restoration of the Empire"
 monarchy.20.d:0 "Chinese monarchists have recently gained enough influence to crown an emperor. Among the Chinese monarchists, there is much debate on who deserves to be crowned emperor.\n\nSome Han monarchists claim the former Marquis of Extended Grace, Zhu Yuxun, would be the appropriate choice. Zhu Yuxun, as his former title states, is descendant of the imperial family of the Ming dynasty. In 1929, he petitioned the government for help due to his destitution and lack of ability to fulfill his duties. His title was abolished and he was paid a stipend instead. No one has seen him since and it may be difficult to find him.\n\nAnother candidate being advocate by Han monarchists is the Duke Yansheng, Kong Lingyi. He is, like his title suggests, a direct descendant of Confucius.\n\nThe Manchu monarchists advocate giving the Xuantong Emperor, Puyi, his throne back. While he was allowed to keep his title and receives an annual subsidy from the Republic of China, he will still probably accept the offer of becoming Emperor of China. However, some view him as merely a Japanese puppet. (Only available if at peace with Japan.)\n\nThe final option is a bit of an unorthodox choice. Some advocate giving Yuan Keding, son of Yuan Shikai, the throne. Yuan Shikai was a general famous for his role leading up to the abdication of the last Qing Emperor, his autocratic rule as first President of China, and his attempt to restore the Chinese monarchy with himself as the Hongxian Emperor.\n\nWhich faction turned out to be the most influential?"

 monarchy.22.d:0 "Indian monarchists have recently gained enough influence to crown an emperor. Among the Indian monarchists, there is much debate on who deserves to be crowned emperor.\n\nAmong Indian Sikhs, some would want Bamba Sutherland crowned empress. Sutherland is the eldest, surviving child of Maharajah Duleep Singh, the last Maharaja of the Sikh Empire. However, she may be unpopular because when she returned to Lahore from her childhood in England, she was said to have \"lived like an alien in her father's kingdom.\"\n\nAnother option is the last Maharaja of Travancore. He is a patron of education and under his rule, Travancore established a university and spent 40% of their revenue on education.\n\nAmong Indian Muslims, some would like to see Nizam Osman Ali Khan. He was the last Nizam of Hyderabad and Berar. He is a devout Sunni Muslim.\n\nThe final choice is Sir Sayajirao Gaekwad III. He is the Maharaja of Baroda State. He is rather old, so if he has died, we can crown his grandson.\n\nWhich faction turned out to be the most influential?"

Among the French monarchists, there is much debate on who deserves to be crowned king.\n\nSome advocate the head of the House of Orléans. The House of Orléans is one of the many claimants to the French throne. It governed France from 1830-1848 in the July Monarchy of King Louis Philippe I.\n\nThe next option is the Napoleon Bonaparte VI. He is the a descendant of Napoleon III, President of the Second Republic and Emperor of the Second Empire.\n\nFinally, the Legitimist claimant to the French throne used to control the Spanish monarchy until they lost their throne.\n\nWhich faction turned out to be the most influential?"

 monarchy.27.d:0 "Somehow, despite American values conflicting with monarchism, American monarchists have gained enough influence to crown a monarch. The monarchists advocate giving the crown to a descendant of one of the greatest presidents in US history. Unfortunately, George Washington never had children so the monarchists are now debating.\n\nThe primary faction advocates giving Jessie Harlan Lincoln the crown. She is the granddaughter of Abraham Lincoln, freer of the slaves and savour of the Union. She is last surviving adult descendant of Lincoln.\n\nAlternatively, some suggest giving Franklin Roosevelt the crown. He has guided our nation through the Great Depression and comes from a great political family. However, if he is dead, we can crown his son, James Roosevelt.\n\nWho is the Emperor of America?"

 monarchy.32.a:0 "Okay."
 monarchy.33.t:0 "King of Bavaria"
