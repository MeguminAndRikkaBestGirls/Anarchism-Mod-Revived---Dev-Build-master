 anarchy.1.t:0 "The International Revolution"
 anarchy.1.d:0 "With the royal portraits burned, the revolutionaries in [Root.GetName] are trying to determine the best direction for the revolution. Some see the Soviet Union as a success to emulate while others believe the state to be inherently oppressive. Which side won the debate?"
 anarchy.1.a:0 "The Anarchists did."
 anarchy.1.b:0 "The Leninists did."
 anarchy.2.t:0 "Free Speech for Fascists?"
 anarchy.2.d:0 "\"Should free speech apply to fascists? Fascists ideals directly contradict our society. They desire a hierarchical society that oppress minorities and workers while we desire the exact opposite.\"\n\nOr so claims some people in our communities. Should fascists be allowed to say what they want?"
 anarchy.2.a:0 "Free speech does not include hate speech."
 anarchy.2.b:0 "Free speech makes a free society."
 anarchy.3.t:0 "The Anarchist International"
 anarchy.3.d:0 "The anarchists in France have come to us with an interesting proposal. They ask that we form a new International of anarchists to help fight against the capitalists, fascists, and Stalinsts. This International will help spread anarchism across the globe and bring liberation to the oppressed proletariat of nation-states, according to the French anarchists."
 anarchy.3.a:0 "An excellent idea!"
 anarchy.3.b:0 "We do not have time for such nonsense."
 anarchy.4.t:0 "The Birth of the Fifth International"
 anarchy.4.desc:0 "Despite how scattered and unorganized the anarchist movement may seem to outsiders, a coalition of anarchists in what use to be France and Spain formed a new International. Solidarity with workers around the world was a key element in a spokesperson's speech today when the Fifth International was announced.\n\nThis new International goes beyond a standard political International, but as is a military alliance between the various communities. While evidence is scare on the intention of this new International, some have speculated the military alliance is merely to serve as a deterrent to would be capitalist, fascist, and Stalinist invaders. Yet others say this International has the goal of bringing about a worldwide anarchist revolution. Regardless of the intention of this new organization, this is surely to shake up the political sphere of Europe for the coming years."
 anarchy.4.a:0 "Solidarity forever!"
 anarchy.4.b:0 "How many Internationals will those commies make?"
 anarchy.4.c:0 "The communists fight among themselves."
 anarchy.4.d:0 "Damn anarchists."
 anarchy.4.e:0 "Hmm..."
 anarchy.5.t:0 "Socialism on the Rise"
 anarchy.5.d:0 "'While workers rise up against their oppressors around the world, those who claim to have achieved class consciousness in [Root.GetName] sit idly by and wait for change to come from within a political system so thoroughly corrupt, only revolution could save us from it!'\n\nSo speak new voices in the [Root.GetAdjective] socialist movement. Referring to the rule of [Root.GetRulingParty] as a dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, they have begun calling for it to be brought out of power by any means necessary. Whether those means will come from within or without remains to be seen."
 anarchy.5.a:0 "The unions are the driving force of revolution."
 anarchy.5.a.tt:0 "Increases the chance of a general strike."
 anarchy.5.b:0 "Insurrection is the driving force of revolution."
 anarchy.5.b.tt:0 "Increases the chance of popular support for a socialist uprising."
 anarchy.6.t:0 "Start of a General Strike"
 anarchy.6.d:0 "\"We have been cursed with the reign of gold long enough. Those who produce should have, but we know that those who produce the most - that is, those who work hardest and at the most difficult and most menial tasks - have the least. With faith and hope and courage, we hold our heads erect and with dauntless spirit marshal for the march from capitalism to socialism, from slavery to freedom, from barbarism to civilization.\"\n\nThus was the passionate speech of a union leader outside the capitol announcing his union's strike and calling for other unions to join in a general strike in [Root.GetName].\n\nWhile historians will be debating for years about the speech's effect on the political climate, one thing is certain - over the next few weeks, more and more unions joined the strike. We can no longer ignore the strike and its effects are devistating the economy."
 anarchy.6.a:0 "Damn anarchists and communists!"
 anarchy.6.a.tt:0 "The general strike will last for a year or until capitalism and the state in [Root.GetName] collapses. If the general strike is not successful, the only remaining option for the radicals will be revolution."
 anarchy.7.t:0 "The Collapse of Capitalism and the State"
 anarchy.7.d:0 "When the union leader called for a strike a few months ago, no one really batted an eye. \"Strikes happen all the time,\" a prominent business men said. However, politicians and capitalists started growing more concerned when other unions started joining in the strike. With all major facets of industry and service striking, the country's economy was suffering. The state deployed the army to try to break up the strike and businesses similarly hired mercenaries.\n\nThe efforts to disperse the strike only seems to have emboldened it. With the state and business unable to enforce their respective authority, communities started establishing self-governing communes and syndicates. What unites these communes and syndicates is a strong disdain for capitalism and the state.\n\nRegardless of what these individual communities do, it looks like a revolution is here."
 anarchy.7.a:0 "The tides of history will sweep away the past."
 anarchy.8.t:0 "Class Conflicts Divide [Root.GetName]"
 anarchy.8.d:0 "The revolutionary socialist movement, once a fringe popular among radical academics in theory and troublemakers in practice, has seen increased support among the [Root.GetAdjective] working class. The fact that even more people choose to identify themselves with a 'class' at all implies that socialist ideas are spreading beyond those who actively seek to overthrow the state.\n\n[Root.GetRulingParty] members lament this development, longing for a time when '[Root.GetAdjective]' was what people identified as first and foremost. Their concerns are not unfounded. It could be argued that a social revolution is already underway, occurring on several levels of society, and it may be too late to stop it."
 anarchy.8.a:0 "The people may call themselves whatever they want."
 anarchy.9.t:0 "Soldiers Desert to Socialist Partisans"
 anarchy.9.d:0 "'Capitalists and nationalists would have you spill your blood for them on the front lines, turning brother against brother over disputes that do not concern the working man! Instead of taking up arms against workers who struggle abroad, raise them against the oppressors and overthrow the tyrants!'\n\nThe army, usually the protectors of capital and the state, has proven not to be immune to socialist agitation spreading rapidly in [Root.GetName]. Soldiers are deserting, refusing to fight for their country, sometimes going as far as joining partisan movements that claim to be preparing for revolution."
 anarchy.9.a:0 "Perhaps they are merely fighting for a different [Root.GetName]."
 anarchy.10.t:0 "The [GetMonth] Revolution"
 anarchy.10.d:0 "The notion that the socialist movement represents the people has certainly gotten wind in its sails in [Root.GetName], where the public support for a libertarian form of socialism has increased rapidly in the past months. But those who call for revolution are no longer a disparate collection of guerrillas and disgruntled labor unions. The group behind the call for revolt is organized enough to demolish the government if they succeed.\n\nNevertheless, if the revolution started now, it could hardly be executed without launching [Root.GetName] into civil war. Should the revolutionaries risk tearing the nation in two to satisfy their impatience, or wait for a better opportunity in the future?"
 anarchy.10.a:0 "Those who wish to make history must act today!"
 anarchy.10.b:0 "Revolution is inevitable. The inevitable can wait."
 anarchy.11.t:0 "Socialists Fight the Fake Revolution"
 anarchy.11.d:0 "'[Root.GetName] is the home of a fake revolution! Socialists have always argued for a stateless, classless, and moneyless society, but what has [Root.GetRulingParty] done instead? They have seized state power and have formed their own ruling class! We have simply traded our old masters for new ones. We shall rectify this past mistake and finally achieve true communism!'\n\nSo speak new voices in the [Root.GetAdjective] socialist movement. They have begun calling for it to be brought out of power by any means necessary. Whether those means will come from within or without remains to be seen."
 anarchy.11.a:0 "There may be those in the government itself who support such ideas."
 anarchy.11.a.tt:0 "Increases the chance of internal support for a socialist coup."
 anarchy.11.b:0 "A movement for the people must seek support from the people."
 anarchy.11.b.tt:0 "Increases the chance of popular support for a socialist uprising."
 anarchy.12.t:0 "Anarchists in Catalonia"
 anarchy.12.d:0 "During the Spanish Civil War, the Republican faction was a coalition of groups who were loyal to the Spanish Republic or, at least, did not want fascists in charge of their lives. This faction consisted of left-leaning liberals, communists, and anarchists.\n\nThe anarchists control large parts of Catalonia and would be likely willing to help us if we offer them some concessions. However, they may too start rebelling if we stomp on their liberties too much. How do we proceed?"
 anarchy.12.a:0 "Let the Anarchists assist us."
 anarchy.12.a.tt:0 "Catalonia will become independent and will be controlled by Anarchists. We will create a faction with them to fight the Nationalists. The Anarchist militia may be rather helpful in this war."
 anarchy.12.b:0 "The Anarchists will cause nothing but trouble."
 anarchy.12.b.tt:0 "Catalonia will become independent and will be controlled by Anarchists. We will go to war with them to reclaim our land. The Anarchist militia may be rather big and cause us trouble though when we are already in a civil war."
 anarchy.13.t:0 "The Worker's Revolution"
 anarchy.13.d:0 "The rift between Leninists and Libertarian Socialists, such as anarchists, has pretty much existed since the founding of the ideologies. While both desire a similar goal of the stateless, classless, and moneyless society, they differ on how this goal should be achieved.\n\nLeninists, inspired by the successful Russian Revolution of 1917, see the use of transitional state as a necessary tool to protect the revolution from those that may want to destroy it. However, anarchists argue those in charge of a state will always become their own separate class and develop their own interests, distinct from the proletariat, thus will never willingly give up state power so the state must be abolished during the revolution.\n\nNeedless to say, this arguing will probably never end, but which side is more influential in our revolution?"
 anarchy.13.a:0 "The Libertarian Socialists are."
 anarchy.13.b:0 "The Leninists are."
 anarchy.16.t:0 "The Sun Has Set"
 anarchy.16.d:0 "With the recent removal of Scotland from control of the Crown, our country can no longer be called a \"United Kingdom.\" People are sure to start calling us England again."
 anarchy.16.a:0 "Well, I say!"
 anarchy.17.t:0 "The Spanish Civil War"
 anarchy.17.d:0 "Spain is currently involved in a civil war between fascists and reactionaries on one side and anarchists and Trotskyists on the other. There are a sizable amount of people who support Soviet style communism. We can support them, but it may cause some in-fighting between the various leftist groups."
 anarchy.17.a:0 "Support Spanish Stalinists"
 anarchy.17.b:0 "Let's not involve ourselves in Spanish Socialism."
 anarchy.18.t:0 "Leftist Infighting"
 anarchy.18.d:0 "Stalinists, with the support of the Soviet Union, have started fighting against the anarchists and Trotskyists to ensure Spanish communism emulates the Soviet Union. This will weaken the war effort."
 anarchy.18.a:0 "That's not good."
 anarchy.18.b:0 "If you can't beat 'em, join 'em."
 anarchy.19.t:0 "Resignation of Stalin"
 anarchy.19.d:0 "Due to internal pressures by the Soviet leadership, Chairman Joseph Stalin was forced to resign. Stalin feared if he did not resign, the Soviet leadership may have attempted a coup or plunged the Soviet Union into a civil war. Two possible replacements are being considered.\n\nLeon Trotsky, who is currently exiled, is the current pick among Soviet leadership. In January 1923, Lenin suggested that Stalin should be removed as the party's general secretary and asked Trotsky to denounce Stalin at the Twelfth Party Congress. It seems that Lenin wanted Trotsky to be his successor over Stalin. Should we follow up on Lenin's wishes?\n\nThe other option is being pushed for by those in the Politburo with anarchist sympathies. Victor Serge, a former anarchist turned Bolshevik, is a harsh critic of Stalin's regime. Those supporting him believe he may help mend the divide between anarchists and Marxists.\n\nWho should become the next leader?"
 anarchy.19.a:0 "Leon Trotsky is now Chairman!"
 anarchy.19.b:0 "Victor Serge is now Chairman!"
 anarchy.20.t:0 "The Worker's Revolution"
 anarchy.20.d:0 "The rift between Leninists and Libertarian Socialists, such as anarchists, has pretty much existed since the founding of the ideologies.

 anarchy.20.b:0 "The Leninists are."
 anarchy.21.t:0 "Anti-Bolshevik Activity"
 anarchy.21.d:0 "Some people who live in actually existing socialism insist it's not actually socialism. These anarchists and other 'libertarian' socialists argue the Soviet Union is actually counter-revolutionary. We can deal with these people by sending them to some labor camps in Siberia, if you desire, Comrade [From.GetLeader]."
 anarchy.21.a:0 "Anti-Bolshevik Activity must be suppressed."
 anarchy.21.b:0 "Maybe they have a point..."
 anarchy.21.c:0 "We must encourage this kind of discussion."
 anarchy.22.t:0 "US Style Marxism"
 anarchy.22.d:0 "With the Vanguard achieving its goals, the first chairman needs to be decided with two primary candidates.\n\nNorman Thomas of The Socialist Party of America is a Presbyterian minister, pacifist, and six-time presidential candidate. A disciple of Eugene Debs and famed pacifist, Thomas initially expressed admiration for the Russian Revolution, but grew disillusioned and became a fervent anti-Stalinist. However, some Marxist revolutionaries such as Leon Trotsky thought he went too far to criticizing Marxism itself instead of just Stalinism.\n\nAlternatively, General Secretary of the Communist Party USA, Earl Browder, is another option for Chairman. During WWI, Browder served time in prison as a conscientious objector to conscription and the war. After his release, he became an active member of the American Communist movement, soon working as an organizer on behalf of the Communist International. Some, however, believe Browder is nothing but a stooge for Stalin; a former NKVD recruiter, Louis Budenz, even claimed that Browder and himself had participated in discussions with Soviet intelligence officials the plans to assassinate Leon Trotsky."
 anarchy.22.a:0 "Norman Thomas is Chairman"
 anarchy.22.b:0 "Earl Browder is Chairman"
 anarchy.23.t:0 "Korea Revolts"
 anarchy.23.d:0 "What we have feared would happen happened. Anarchists in Korea has gotten militias together and are rebelling against our lawful rule. How should we proceed?"
 anarchy.23.a:0 "Give them independence"
 anarchy.23.b:0 "We shall squash this rebellion"
 anarchy.23.b.tt:0 "Korea revolts; taking the north and south with them."

 anarchy.24.a:0 "Freedom at last."
 anarchy.25.t:0 "Liberty in the Soviet Union"
 anarchy.25.d:0 "The Communist Party has decided loosen its control over the state and its people ever so slightly. The party is debating which path it should take. Some advocate a more libertarian form of socialism. Others think reforming into a capitalistic economy would be best. Which side wins?"
 anarchy.25.a:0 "Capitalism and Democracy!"
 anarchy.25.b:0 "Mutual Aid and Worker Councils!"
 anarchy.26.t:0 "Socialists in Government?"
 anarchy.26.d:0 "The socialist movement in [Root.GetName], fueled by broad dissatisfaction among the working class and radical trends among academics, has grown large enough to lead to the formation of several parties and organizations. After one of these has gained considerable support in the current election, politicians in [Root.GetRulingParty] have started debating whether or not to seek their support in forming a government. Although they consider our democratic institutions to be little more than bourgeois tyranny, they seem eager to make the changes they want to see through cooperating with the government rather than overthrowing it."
 anarchy.26.a:0 "Rather reform than revolution!"
 anarchy.26.b:0 "A broad coalition of republican parties is preferable."
 anarchy.27.t:0 "Socialists Influence Foreign Policy"
 anarchy.27.d:0 "Socialists often consider themselves to be part of an international revolution, and our choice to accept them as partners in our government has drawn the attention of many of their international allies. Representatives of anarchist organizations and socialist parties maintain close ties to nations which have abandoned our form of government in favor of a non-hierarchical society, ties which we may need to acknowledge in [Root.GetAdjective] foreign policy if we wish to retain their support."
 anarchy.27.a:0 "We should embrace our common causes."
 anarchy.27.b:0 "Down that path lies the dissolution of [Root.GetName] itself."
 anarchy.28.t:0 "Election: Socialist Majority"
 anarchy.28.d:0 "The current election has resulted in victory for the socialist parties and anarchist organizations, with mixed reactions from the former administration. While the new rulers claim to represent the people as a whole, they view our republican system of government as a bourgeois dictatorship which seeks to oppress the proletariat, leading to discussion on how to best abolish the state and bring rule back to the people. In some nations, the revolution began in rivers of blood. In [Root.GetName] it didn't, but it may yet end in revolution."
 anarchy.28.a:0 "This is troubling, but they truly do represent the majority."
 anarchy.28.b:0 "We must stop them before they abolish our very way of life!"
 anarchy.29.t:0 "Panslavic Union"
 anarchy.29.d:0 "Russia has invited us to a Panslavic Union. This would be an defensive faction and a brotherhood of all Slavs. We could have much to gain for joining this union. Should we?"
 anarchy.29.a:0 "Join."
 anarchy.29.b:0 "Don't join."
 anarchy.32.t:0 "Representative for Revolutionary America"
 anarchy.32.d:0 "Because most of the world has not joined us in revolution, we must still have some amount of diplomacy with the rest of the world. Therefore, we need to choose some representatives for our society. We have two main contenders.\n\nOption 1 is Emma Goldman. She became attracted to anarchism after the Haymarket Affair. She attracts crowds of thousands on her lectures on anarchism, women's rights, and social justice. She was deported from America after trying to convince people not to register for the World War I draft. She has since returned to aid our revolution and is ready to help in any way possible.\n\nOption 2 is Dorothy Day, famous for co-founding the Catholic Worker Movement. She advocates for nonviolent, direct action to help the poor and homeless. While she has described herself as an anarchist on many occasions, she advocates for the Catholic economy theory of distributism, which she considers an alternative to capitalism and socialism. This has caused some to view her with some suspicion.\n\nRegardless who becomes our primary diplomat, both are highly qualified candidates."

 anarchy.37.t:0 "The Burial of Lenin"
 anarchy.37.d:0 "We have decided to remove Lenin from his mausoleum and bury him elsewhere. This was timidly approved by [Root.GetLeader]'s as some advisers said Lenin would never have wanted to be an idol. All that's left is to decide where to bury him."

 anarchy.38.d:0 "The Soviet Union just announced the permanent closure of Lenin's Mausoleum.

When asked about the resignation, a Soviet diplomat refused to comment saying, \"All you need to know about the resignation is in the press release.\"\n\nForeign policy experts are in a panic at this massive, unpredicted upset. Some are concerned his replacement will, as one expert put it, \"make Stalin look like an anarchist\". While others are heralding the announcement as the fall of the dictatorial regime. Only time will time who is right."
